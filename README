DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple slurps an XML formatted config file into a hashref
  (or 'unslurps' a hashref out to an XML file).


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires XML::Parser
  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm

  Win32 users may be interested to discover that XML::Parser is shipped
  with the base install of ActivePerl from ActiveState Corp.  Storable.pm
  can be installed using the PPM utility.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest


STATUS

  This version (1.03) is the current stable release.  This version is
  believed to be thread-safe (the faulty locking code from 1.00 which was
  removed in 1.01 has been fixed).
