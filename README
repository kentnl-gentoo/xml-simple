DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple slurps an XML formatted config file into a hashref
  (or 'unslurps' a hashref out to an XML file).


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires XML::Parser
  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm

  Win32 users may be interested to discover that XML::Parser is shipped
  with the base install of ActivePerl from ActiveState Corp.  Storable.pm
  can be installed using the PPM utility (and if you've installed DBI,
  you've probably already got it).


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).


STATUS

  Current release is version 1.01.  Version 1.00 was intended to be the
  first stable release but had serious backwards compatibility
  problems with locking routines for thread safing.  This version removes
  the offending code and is therefore stable and safe in non-threaded
  applications.  Let me know if you are able to test the next attempt at
  a thread-safe version.

  This module is known not to be thread safe - the locking code has
  been temporarily removed due to backwards compatibility problems.
  It will be fixed and re-instated in the next release.
