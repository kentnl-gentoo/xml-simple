DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple - Trivial API for reading and writing XML (esp config files)


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires XML::Parser
  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm

  Win32 users may be interested to discover that XML::Parser is shipped
  with the base install of ActivePerl from ActiveState Corp.  Storable.pm
  can be installed using the PPM utility.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest


STATUS

  This version (1.05) is the current stable release.  This version is
  believed to be thread-safe.

NEW IN THIS RELEASE

  - code re-org to make internals all OO for easier extending
  - added 'noattr' option to tell XMLout() not to use attributes (only
    nested elements) and XMLin() to discard attributes
  - added 'suppressempty' option to tell XMLin what to do with elements
    with no attributes and no content
  - added 'parseropts' option for specifying options which should be
    passed to the underlying XML::Parser object
  - added 'forcecontent' option to force text content to parse to a
    hash value even if the element has no attributes
  - fix for forcearray getting applied to text content
  - integrated patch from Paul Lindner to work around filenames sometimes
    being seen as XML when running under mod_perl
  - integrated patch from Edward Avis: filename '-' means stdin
  - fixed bug where a missing key attribute could cause a crash
  - added a warning message for above situation
  - added 'support' for CDATA sections - they always worked, but now
    they're in the test suite which should ensure they keep working
  - fixed error message when caching enabled but parsing from filehandle
  - fixed empty elements being skipped by XMLout() when folding enabled
  - fixed text content of '0' being skipped by XMLout()

  See 'Changes' for a detailed history.
