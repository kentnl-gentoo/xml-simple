DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple slurps an XML formatted config file into a hashref
  (or 'unslurps' a hashref out to an XML file).


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires XML::Parser
  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm

  Win32 users may be interested to discover that XML::Parser is shipped
  with the base install of ActivePerl from ActiveState Corp.  Storable.pm
  can be installed using the PPM utility (and if you've installed DBI,
  you've probably already got it).


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).


STATUS

  Current release is version 1.00 - the first full release following
  the alphas and betas.  The module name and subroutine names changed
  in the first beta release but have been stable since - the 'convert'
  script will upgrade code written for the alpha release.

  Although the module does not make use of threads, it is believed to be
  thread safe to the best of the author's knowledge.  (Access to all
  globals is protected by locks).
