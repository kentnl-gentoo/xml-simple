DESCRIPTION

  XML::Simple - Easy API to read/write XML (esp config files)


PREREQUISITES

  XML::Simple requires XML::Parser (if you're running ActivePerl, you'll
  already have this installed).

  The optional caching features of XML::Simple also require Storable.pm.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

  Once the archive is unpacked, use these commands:

      perl Makefile.PL
      make
      make test
      make install

  If for some reason, you can't run these commands, you can simple copy 
  the Simple.pm file to your lib/XML directory (where Parser.pm lives).

  If you want to test the module, but don't have 'make', try:

      perl maketest


STATUS

  This version (1.08) is the current stable release.  This version is
